- ##### `Exam Paper Flow`:
For Exams with multiple papers, this determines the order of flow during examination.

There are currently 3 available options to choose from:

1. **Force Continuous** : Ensures that once a paper has been written the system brings up the next paper immediately.
2. **Client Controlled**: Examinee decides when to start a paper.
3. **Server Controlled**: Here the Exam manager decides when to start a paper.

- ##### `Show Answers After Exam`: YES or NO

- ##### `Allow Inter-Paper Navigation`: Allows the examinee/client to switch between multiple papers. It overrides the `Force Continuous` settings.








 > **Note**: You can save an Exam Project containing multiple exams but you can only export single exams into **The Manager** once at a time.
