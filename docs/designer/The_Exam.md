### The First Step

The very first step to building questions is to create an **Exam Project**.

1. Click on `File`

### The Second Step
**The next step is to fill the Exam Properties and Settings fields. Below are brief explanations of what the fields are for**

- **Exam Title:** 

This is visible to the end-user while taking the exam; it is more like the **name of the Exam**. e.g. *WAEC EXAM, RATELSOFT EXAMS, GTBank Tests *etc.

- **Exam Code:** 

The Exam Code should be unique for all the exams being imported into the Exam Manager and should not contain spaces or characters outside the Alpha-numeric range. e.g. *GTBTEST201, WAEC1998, JAMB2020.*

- **Branding Banner:** 

With the Designer, customers are allowed to imprint some level of their presence on the Exam, such that it is visible to their examinees while taking the exam. e.g. A School Logo, Company Banner, Military Insignia and Moto can all come into play here. 

- **Branding Colour:**

Establishments that have peculiar brand colour can choose their colours, this gives the examinee a familiarity feeling and an identity to the brand.

- **Exam Description and General Instruction:** 

The Exam Descriptions and Instructions must show up for the examinee before start of exam. So Whatever last minute Exam Instruction and Description are entered for the examinee.

> Note: The Exam Description and General Instruction fields must not be left blank, otherwise you won't be able to export the Exam you have created.


##### EXAM PROPERTIES

- **Paper Flow:**
For Exams with multiple papers, this determines the order of flow during examination.

There are currently 3 available options to choose from:

1. **Force Continuous** : In situations where there are multiple papers to be written by the examinee, this settings ensures that once a paper has been written the system brings up the next paper immediately. The System controls the Paper flow.
2. **Client Controlled**: The application which the Examinee takes Exams on is called the *Client*; so with this settings, the examinee decides when to start a paper.
3. **Server Controlled**: Here the SmartExaminer Manager decides when Examinees are to start a paper.

- **Show Answers After Exam: **

Often, formal examinations prefer setting this as `NO`, that is the Answers are not shownto the examinee after the exam is over. However, when mock exams or tutorials are being conducted with this, selecting a `YES` may be preferable.

- **Allow Inter-Paper Navigation:** 

Allows the examinee/client to switch between multiple papers. It however overrides the `Client Controlled` Paper flow settings.

 > **Note**: You can save an Exam Project containing multiple exams but you can only export single exams into **The Manager** once at a time.
