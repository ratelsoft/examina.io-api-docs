Like on most other application, the SmartExaminer's Tool Bar on which the `File` `Edit`  and `Help` are displayed, is the starting point in working with the SmartExaminer Designer.

Before we explore each of the basic active tabs, let's introduce you to the environment.

- From the image above, the blank field beneath the `Exam Explorer` is the field of display where Exams, Papers and Questions being created will be listed. 

- The next field is that of the `Properties` this field displays active Exam, Paper and Question property settings, which guides on how the questions and exam features are configured.

- The `Hint` field displays clues and information regarding some of the commands you will see as we begin to build questions, and how to work with them.

  On the Untitled Exam field, you can create Exam Papers. 
  From a school's perspective, the **Papers** can be regarded as Modules, Courses or Subjects, depending on what term it bears in your school.



### Adding Papers and Questions

  1. Right click on `UNTITLED EXAM` and the dropdown reveals options to create a 
  - `NEW EXAM PAPER` 
  - `Import Papers from File` 
  - `Export Exam to File` and a few others.

  3. From the Paper, you can go ahead and create `Questions` by right clicking on the `Paper` or just click the **New Question** icon under the Exam Explorer.
