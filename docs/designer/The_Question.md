### **Paper Properties and Settings**

1.  **Option Count:**
This defines the number of answer choices which will be visible from which the answer would be chosen and must be between 2 and 10.

2. **Correct Option:** 
This is the option bearing the correct answer.

3. **Allow Shuffle Choices:** 

This feature can be set to alternate and randomly display Question Options on the different client App. 
(For example, if this property is `allowed`, Option A may appear on another client/examinee's page as Option B, nevertheless, the correct answer is maintained regardless of what option it appears on.)

4. **Question Section:**

In a situation where Paper Sections have been created, this avails the opportunity to assign particular questions to a target Paper Section. question must belong to a section and can only be in a single section within a paper.
On how to create Paper Sections, refer to Paper Properties on 'Creating an Exam Paper' Page.


5. **Add Case Study/Passage:** 

A Case Study/Passage can be added to this question. This can be a sort of question guide just like a 'Comprehension' with which the examinee is required to read and answer more than a question originating from the script. It could also be literature scripts, sample problems/exhibits which could be used as a guide to answer the given question.
Therefore A Case Study often precedes a question or series of questions. So choosing `Yes` for Add case study, adds The Case Study field in question entry plane.


6. **Case Study Label:** 

The default title settings for the Case Study/Passage is Case Study, but The Case Study Label feature affords the opportunity to rename the desired Passage. So if it's a Comprehension, you can name it so at this point.


7. **Question Score/Value:**
is the mark assigned to the question. The default is 1 mark. For half mark, use 0.5

### **Questions Entry**

The Question Entry Plane or field is where you build the Question, Question Options and Explanation/Reference if available.

** The Question Edit Panel has features such as are present in The MircoSoft Word. Example -**

- **Body Text:** Refers to the style of the text, It's a body of text by default, but you have options to make the Text a paragraph, different headings, a quote, etcetera.

- **Colour:** One may want to change the texts to a particular colour, there are assorted ranges of colours to pick from.

- **Bold**

- **Word Alignment**

- **Import image**:
Ensure that the image being imported is not larger than 650 pixels. This is so that the image could show properly across all devices (PC or Mobile), and the image file cannot be greater than 500kb, this so that when the files are being downloaded by the web server it doesn't take so long.
You may need an editor to resize images that do not meet the above specifications.
