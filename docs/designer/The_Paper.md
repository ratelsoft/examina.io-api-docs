##### Paper Properties

- **Paper Duration:**

This is the Time duration of the Paper in minutes. The minimum allowed time is 5 minutes >.

- **Section Arrangement:** 

Section Arrangement defines how the questions would be lined up or presented to examinees will taking the exam. i.e. if you wish the questions to flow in `sequence` or appear `randomly`. 

    (e.g. In The Use of English, If you have three sections listed in order 
    - 'Oral English' 
    - 'Comprehension' 
    - 'Nearest in meaning' 
    At a RANDOMIZED setting, the system gets to pick questions alternating in no particular order from the above listed sections. 
    However, When on a SEQUENTIAL setting, the questions will first come from 'Oral English', next from 'Comprehension' and finally from 'Nearest in Meaning'.)

    Clicking on the `Contents and Sections` tab at the foot of the page, reveals further settings which can be utilized to effect changes on the Paper Contents and Paper Sections.
    e.g. you can assign the number of questions to be answered from each section, while also deciding if the questions within a single section is randomized or sequenced.

- **Questions to Answer:** 

This defines the number of questions which examinees would be presented to answer while taking the Paper. 

This is most useful if you wish to allow questions to be selected randomly as a subset of a 'question bank'.
This means that there may be times when you have created or imported a pool of questions from which you would want examinees to answer from, desginating a specific number of questions to answer will ensure the systems presents just that to the examinee. 

    It is advisable to set this after all Questions have been created, this is because further question addition after selecting the number of **Questions to Answer** invalidates this settings, returning it to the total number of questions add to The Paper.
