- **Paper Duration:** Time allowed in minutes. From 5 minutes  >

- **Section Arrangement:** defines how the exam paper would be lined up i.e. if you wish the exam to flow in `sequence` or appear `randomly`. 
(e.g. If you have three sections listed in order - 'Comprehension', 'Nearest in meaning', and 'Opposite in meaning', you may want questions from 'Comprehension' to come before 'Nearest in meaning', therefore the setting would be `Sequential`)
